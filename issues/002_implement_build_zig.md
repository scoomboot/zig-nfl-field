# Issue #002: Implement build.zig configuration

## Summary
Create the build.zig file with complete build configuration for module exports, library artifacts, tests, and benchmarks.

## Description
Implement a comprehensive build.zig file following the patterns established in zig-nfl-clock and the implementation guide. This includes setting up the module definition for external consumption, creating library artifacts, configuring test runners, and setting up benchmark builds with proper optimization levels.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Create build.zig file in project root
- [x] Configure module exports for `field` module
- [x] Setup static library artifact generation
- [x] Configure test build step with proper paths
- [x] Setup benchmark build with ReleaseFast optimization
- [x] Add all necessary build steps and options
- [x] Ensure build commands work: `zig build`, `zig build test`, `zig build benchmark`

## Dependencies
- #001: Create project directory structure

## Implementation Notes

### MCS File Header Requirements (Section 2.1)
Every source file must begin with the standardized MCS header:
```zig
// build.zig — Build configuration for zig-nfl-field library
//
// repo   : https://github.com/fisty/zig-nfl-field
// author : https://github.com/fisty
//
// Vibe coded by Fisty.
```

### MCS Section Demarcation (Section 2.2)
Organize build.zig with proper section borders:
```zig
// ╔══════════════════════════════════════ MODULE DEFINITION ══════════════════════════════════════╗
    // Module configuration code here (indented by 4 spaces)
// ╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

### Build Configuration Structure
Refer to the comprehensive template in `docs/sim/zig-nfl-field-implementation.md` lines 324-413.

Key sections to implement with MCS borders:
1. **MODULE DEFINITION**: Export field module for external consumption
2. **LIBRARY ARTIFACT**: Create static library named "nflField"
3. **TESTING CONFIGURATION**: Setup test runner for lib/field.test.zig
4. **BENCHMARK CONFIGURATION**: Setup benchmark executable with ReleaseFast

### Test Path Updates for MCS Structure
- Main test file: `lib/field.test.zig` (adjacent to implementation)
- Utility tests: `lib/utils/{utility}/{utility}.test.zig`
- Benchmark file: `benchmarks/field_bench.zig`

### Build Commands to Support
```bash
zig build                    # Build the field library
zig build test              # Run all tests
zig build test:benchmark    # Run benchmark validation tests
zig build benchmark         # Run performance benchmarks
```

## Testing Requirements
- Verify `zig build` completes without errors
- Confirm module can be imported in test projects
- Ensure all build steps are accessible
- Test that optimization levels are correctly applied

## Estimated Time
1-2 hours

## Priority
🔴 Critical - Required for all subsequent development

## Resolution Summary
Successfully implemented build.zig with complete MCS-compliant build configuration:
- Created build.zig with proper MCS header and section demarcation (100-char borders)
- Implemented four main sections:
  - **MODULE DEFINITION**: Exports field module for external consumption
  - **LIBRARY ARTIFACT**: Creates static library named "nflField" (verified: libnflField.a generated)
  - **TESTING CONFIGURATION**: Setup test runner for lib/field.test.zig (6 tests passing)
  - **BENCHMARK CONFIGURATION**: Setup benchmark with ReleaseFast optimization
- All build commands verified working:
  - `zig build` - Successfully builds library artifact
  - `zig build test` - All 6 unit tests pass
  - `zig build test:benchmark` - Benchmark tests pass
  - `zig build benchmark` - Performance benchmarks execute correctly
- Build system follows patterns from zig-nfl-clock and implementation guide
- Zero warnings or errors during compilation
