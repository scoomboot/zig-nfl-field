# Issue #043: Create missing README.md file

## Summary
Create README.md file that is referenced in build.zig.zon but does not exist.

## Description
The build.zig.zon file lists "README.md" in the paths array (line 18), but the file does not exist in the project root. This creates a package integrity issue and prevents users from understanding the library's purpose, installation, and usage.

## Evidence
- **build.zig.zon:18**: `"README.md",` is listed in paths
- **File system**: README.md does not exist in project root
- **Impact**: Users cannot understand library purpose or usage instructions

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create README.md file in project root
- [ ] Include library description and purpose
- [ ] Add installation/usage instructions  
- [ ] Document coordinate system basics
- [ ] Include basic API examples
- [ ] Add link to full documentation
- [ ] Follow standard README structure

## Implementation Notes

### README.md Structure
```markdown
# zig-nfl-field

Zero-dependency Zig library for NFL field representation and coordinate system functionality.

## Features
- Precise NFL field geometry (120x53.33 yards)
- Mathematical coordinate system (X=east-west, Y=north-south)
- Boundary checking and zone detection
- Distance calculations and position validation
- Zero dependencies, pure Zig implementation

## Installation
[Installation instructions]

## Quick Start
[Basic usage examples]

## Coordinate System
[Brief coordinate system explanation with diagram]

## Documentation
[Links to full docs]
```

## Dependencies
- None (standalone issue)

## Testing Requirements
- Verify README renders properly on GitHub
- Ensure all code examples compile
- Check links work correctly

## Estimated Time
30 minutes

## Priority
ðŸŸ¡ High - Essential for library usability and package integrity
