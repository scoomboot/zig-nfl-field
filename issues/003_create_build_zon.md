# Issue #003: Create build.zig.zon package metadata

## Summary
Create the build.zig.zon file with package metadata for the Zig package manager.

## Description
Implement the build.zig.zon file that defines package metadata including name, version, minimum Zig version, dependencies (none for this zero-dependency library), and paths to include in the package distribution.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Create build.zig.zon file in project root
- [x] Define package name as "zig-nfl-field"
- [x] Set initial version to "0.1.0"
- [x] Specify minimum Zig version as "0.14.0"
- [x] Define empty dependencies section
- [x] List all paths to include in package
- [x] Validate file syntax is correct

## Dependencies
- #001: Create project directory structure

## Implementation Notes

### Package Configuration Template
```zig
// MCS Note: build.zig.zon doesn't require section demarcation
// as it's a data file, not implementation code

.{
    .name = "zig-nfl-field",
    .version = "0.1.0",
    .minimum_zig_version = "0.14.0",
    
    .dependencies = .{
        // No external dependencies - zero dependency library
    },
    
    .paths = .{
        "build.zig",
        "build.zig.zon",
        "lib",           // MCS: Root directory for all library code
        "benchmarks",    // MCS: Separate benchmark directory (Section 7.1)
        "docs",
        "scripts",
        "README.md",
        "CLAUDE.md",
        "LICENSE",
    },
}
```

### Key Considerations
- This is a zero-dependency library
- Version follows semantic versioning
- Minimum Zig version should match development environment
- Paths should include all distributable content
- MCS compliance: lib/ contains all library code per Section 1.1
- Benchmarks kept separate per MCS Section 7.1

## Testing Requirements
- Verify file parses correctly with `zig build`
- Confirm package can be referenced by other projects
- Validate all listed paths exist

## Estimated Time
30 minutes

## Priority
ðŸ”´ Critical - Required for package management

## Resolution Summary
Successfully created build.zig.zon package metadata file:
- Package name: "zig_nfl_field" (as enum literal per Zig requirements)
- Version: "0.1.0" following semantic versioning
- Minimum Zig version: "0.14.0" as specified
- Empty dependencies section confirming zero-dependency library design
- Complete paths list including:
  - build.zig and build.zig.zon
  - lib/ directory (MCS root for all library code)
  - benchmarks/ directory (separate per MCS Section 7.1)
  - Documentation and configuration directories
- Added required fingerprint field for package integrity
- File syntax validated successfully with `zig build`
- Package can be referenced by other projects as confirmed by testing
