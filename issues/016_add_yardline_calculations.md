# Issue #016: Add yard line coordinate calculations

## Summary
Implement calculation utilities for yard line positions and conversions.

## Description
Add comprehensive calculation functions for working with yard lines, including interpolation, nearest yard line detection, and coordinate mapping along yard lines.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Add interpolation between yard lines
- [ ] Implement nearest yard line detection with sub-yard precision
- [ ] Create yard line range checking
- [ ] Add first down calculation utilities
- [ ] Implement yard line crossing detection

## Dependencies
- #014: Define YardLine enum

## Implementation Notes
Focus on accurate calculations for game mechanics, including first down markers and field position tracking.

## Testing Requirements
- Test interpolation accuracy
- Test nearest yard line with fractional positions
- Test first down calculations
- Verify yard line crossing detection

## Estimated Time
1.5 hours

## Priority
ðŸŸ¡ High - Essential for game mechanics
