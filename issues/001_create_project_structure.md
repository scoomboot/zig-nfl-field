# Issue #001: Create MCS-compliant project directory structure

## Summary
Establish the MCS-compliant Zig project directory structure for the zig-nfl-field library following Maysara Code Style guidelines.

## Description
Create all necessary directories and subdirectories for the project, following the MCS hierarchical structure defined in Section 1.1-1.3. This includes proper module organization with implementation and test files adjacent to each other, utility subdirectories, and standard project directories.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Create `lib/` directory as root for all library code (MCS Section 1.1)
- [x] Create `lib/utils/` directory for specialized utilities
- [x] Create utility subdirectories: `lib/utils/coordinate/`, `lib/utils/yardline/`, `lib/utils/zone/`
- [x] Create `benchmarks/` directory for performance benchmarks (kept separate per MCS 7.1)
- [x] Create `docs/` directory for documentation
- [x] Create `docs/api/` subdirectory for API documentation
- [x] Create `scripts/` directory for utility scripts
- [x] Create `.claude/` directory for Claude configuration
- [x] Verify directory structure matches MCS requirements

## Dependencies
- None (first issue in the project)

## Implementation Notes

### Required MCS-Compliant Directory Structure (per MCS Section 1.1)
```
zig-nfl-field/
â”œâ”€â”€ .claude/                    # Claude configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/                        # Root directory for all library code
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils/                  # Specialized utilities
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ coordinate/         # Coordinate utility directory
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ yardline/           # Yard line utility directory
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ zone/               # Zone utility directory
â”œâ”€â”€ benchmarks/                 # Performance benchmarks (separate per MCS 7.1)
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/                       # Documentation
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ api/                    # API documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/                    # Utility scripts
â””â”€â”€ issues/                     # Issue tracking (already exists)
```

### Commands to Execute
```bash
# Create main directories
mkdir -p lib/utils/coordinate
mkdir -p lib/utils/yardline
mkdir -p lib/utils/zone
mkdir -p benchmarks
mkdir -p docs/api
mkdir -p scripts
mkdir -p .claude
```

### MCS File Naming Conventions (Section 1.3)
- All filenames use lowercase with underscores (snake_case)
- Implementation files: `field.zig`, `coordinate.zig`
- Test files adjacent to implementation: `field.test.zig`, `coordinate.test.zig`
- Benchmarks in separate directory: `benchmarks/field_bench.zig`

## Testing Requirements
- Verify all directories are created with correct permissions
- Confirm directory structure using `tree` or `ls -la`
- Ensure git recognizes new directories

## Estimated Time
15-30 minutes

## Priority
ðŸ”´ Critical - Build blocker, prevents all other work

*Status: âœ… Resolved*

## Resolution Summary
Successfully created the MCS-compliant directory structure for the zig-nfl-field project:
- Created all required directories using `mkdir -p` commands
- Established proper hierarchical structure with `lib/` as root for all library code
- Created utility subdirectories under `lib/utils/` for coordinate, yardline, and zone utilities
- Set up separate `benchmarks/` directory per MCS Section 7.1
- Created documentation and scripts directories
- Verified structure with `tree` command - all 12 directories created successfully
- Directory structure fully complies with MCS requirements defined in Sections 1.1-1.3
